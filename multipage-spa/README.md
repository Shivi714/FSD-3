# Experiment-1: Basic Client-Side Routing Using React Router

## Unit-3: Implementing Routing in Single Page Applications (SPA)

This experiment demonstrates the implementation of **basic client-side routing** in a **Single Page Application (SPA)** using **React Router**.  
Routing allows navigation between different pages without reloading the entire web page.

---

## 🎯 Aim

To implement basic client-side routing in a Single Page Application using React Router.

---

## 🧰 Software Requirements

- Node.js  
- React  
- React Router DOM  
- Web Browser  

---

## 📘 Theory

Routing in a Single Page Application allows navigation between different views without reloading the page.  
React Router is a popular library used to handle client-side routing in React applications using components such as:

- BrowserRouter  
- Routes  
- Route  

Using React Router improves performance and provides a smooth user experience.

---

## 🧪 Procedure

1. Create a React application using Vite.  
2. Install react-router-dom package.  
3. Wrap the main application with BrowserRouter.  
4. Define routes using Routes and Route components.  
5. Create separate pages (Profile, Dashboard, Header).  
6. Navigate between pages without page reload.
